    Last 2 weeks I was trying to marry GNUstep back focus management with WM's.
    It's quite hard task... But now I know how focus management things works in GNUstep and X11.
    Next [Workspace project](https://github.com/trunkmaster/nextspace/projects/4) probably require more deep 
    integration between GNUstep and WM.
